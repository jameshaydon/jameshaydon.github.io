      <p>This is part 3 of my blog posts about the UK air traffic control meltdown. You
might want to read <a href="/nats-fail">part one</a> and <a href="/what-went-wrong">part two</a>.</p>
<p>Having had some time to process some of the comments about my first post, I
realise now that I was not clear in communicating my thoughts about the
programming style, and how that contributed to the existence of the bug. I will
have another go now. The point I was trying to make was:</p>
<p>With a better programming style, the bug might not have been made <strong>even if the
code is only meant for flight plans with no duplicate waypoints</strong>.<span id="continue-reading"></span>
Of course, I also agree that better specs/requirements would have helped too.</p>
<p>The original post attracted comments of the sort:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is even meant by &quot;imperative&quot; programming? How is it relevant to the rest
of the post?</li>
<li>Why blame the bug on programming style, when it is just that the original code
was not aware of the possibility of waypoints with duplicate names? The
original algorithm (probably) works fine on flight plans with no duplicate
waypoints.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I hope to convince you of in this post is that the programming style <em>does</em>
matter: the bug might not have occurred when using a specific coding style, even
if the programmer was not aware of the duplicate waypoint issue.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-i-mean-by-imperative">What did I mean by &quot;imperative&quot;?</h2>
<p>Using this word was a mistake. What I should have said instead was roughly:
<em>&quot;not correct-by-construction style&quot;</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. I conflated &quot;correct-by-construction&quot;
with my own personal preference when striving to achieve this programming style,
which involves functional programming.</p>
<p>There is no precise definition of what &quot;correct-by-construction&quot; means, but it
would at least include:</p>
<ul>
<li>representing domain objects with programming values as faithfully as possible,</li>
<li>only operating on them with functions that are known to preserve certain
invariants, so that they are &quot;safe&quot;,</li>
<li>building up a solution by composing such functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is that if the &quot;base&quot; functions are &quot;correct&quot; (in some way), then by
induction the full program is too.</p>
<p>In correct-by-construction programming invariants are expressed in terms of the
domain: the &quot;modelling gap&quot; is small. Programs that are not
correct-by-construction have invariants too, but because the programming objects
don't correspond to the domain objects, the invariants are harder to think of
and reasoning about them is more brittle. Compare:</p>
<p><em>correct-by-construction style:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cutting a flight plan short, where the part we cut off is at no point in the
UK, results in a flight plan that fully contains the UK part.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<p><em>non correct-by-construction style:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iterating rightwards in the ADEXP list from the known UK exit point until a a
match is found in the ICAO plan produces the index marking the end of the UK
part.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The former is statement is obvious and unconditionally correct, the latter
requires thought and breaks down in the presence of duplicate waypoint names.</p>
<p>The smaller modelling gap in correct-by-construction style also ensures that
errors, should they occur, are usually &quot;closer&quot;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup> to the route cause, and this
can make failures less serious.</p>
<h2 id="another-look-at-the-problem">Another look at the problem</h2>
<p>Let us from now on assume that <strong><em>we do not know that a flight plan can contain
duplicate waypoints</em></strong> and that we <strong><em>assume they are unique</em></strong>, and look at
the problem anew.</p>
<p>We are given two versions of the flight plan, ICAO and ADEXP, each containing
information the other does not have. Our goal is to extract the UK part of the
ICAO flight plan, using data from the ADEXP plan.</p>
<p>One possibility, which sounds like what the original code did, is to keep the
data as it is and perform various operations until we are satisfied we have
found two indices <code>start_index</code> and <code>end_index</code> which delimit the UK portion of
the flight plan. The process was not correct-by-construction: the end result was
an <code>end_index</code> value for which <code>end_index &lt; start_index</code>. This doesn't
correspond to a sub-flight-plan at all. The code has &quot;gone wrong&quot;, and not
noticed: the invariant that the pair of indices represent a valid sub-plan has
been violated. Noticing that something has gone wrong is important: the closer
you are to the root cause, the more likely the exception will contain the
information that is relevant to those who are dealing with the crash. It may
even have failed gracefully at this point.</p>
<p>The correct-by-construction approach, at least the one that I chose, is to
operate on a version of the flight plan that combines all the information you
need. This therefore involves a first step which works out how the ICAO and
ADEXP plans &quot;match up&quot;.</p>
<p>In the original post this was achieved by a function <code>reconcile :: ICAO p r -&gt; [p] -&gt; [Combined p r]</code>. Now, suppose that I hadn't realised waypoint names were
non-unique, then I would assume the plans can only match up in at most one way.
So I might<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup> have defined something like this instead:</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-haskell "><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">reconcile&#39; </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">::</span><span> (</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">Eq </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">p</span><span>) </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">=&gt; ICAO </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">p r </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">-&gt;</span><span> [</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">p</span><span>] </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">-&gt; Maybe</span><span> (</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">Combined </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">p r</span><span>)

</span><span>reconcile&#39; (</span><span style="color:#d08770;">Leg</span><span> p r rest) (p&#39; : ps) | p == p&#39; = </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">do

</span><span>reconcile&#39; _ _ = </span><span style="color:#d08770;">Nothing
</span></code></pre>
<p>This function is simpler than <code>reconcile</code> from the original post and does the
obvious thing: when reconciling a leg of the ICAO plan with the ADEXP list, it
will skip all the ADEXP points that are not equal to the next point in the ICAO
plan, and then reconciles the rest of the plan recursively.</p>
<p>This function is an example of <a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/">&quot;Parse, don’t
validate&quot;</a>.
Parsing is how semantically meaningful domain values are produced from less
meaningful data, and so is often a necessary first step in
correct-by-construction style. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if the original
code violated precisely this slogan, <em>validated</em> and <em>not parsed</em>. This would be
a snippet of code much like <code>reconcile'</code> above, but that just checks the plans
match up instead of returning a combined plan.</p>
<p>The function <code>reconcile'</code> is <em>wrong</em> because it doesn't consider the possibility
of duplicate waypoints, but much less wrong than the original bug because of the
correct-by-construction programming style. It will either:</p>
<ul>
<li>return <code>Nothing</code> because it can't create a valid domain object (a flight plan),
in which case it <em>knows</em> it should now fail gracefully, or,</li>
<li>succeed correctly, or,</li>
<li>succeed incorrectly: but this is now made much more unlikely (see below) and
far more understandable: the input data was ambiguous.</li>
</ul>
<p>The code for extracting the UK part of the plan is the same as in the original
post, this is quite simple once we have the version of the flight plan which
combines all the information we need. All that changes is pattern matching on a
<code>Maybe</code>-value instead of a list:</p>

<p>The bug would therefore have been completely avoided, even if the failure modes
were bad, and even though the spec might not have mentioned the duplicate
waypoint issue. The reason it still works is that the reconciliation still
exists, and the duplicate waypoint doesn't get in the way of finding it.</p>
<p>The reconciliation is also unique in this case, so the processing of the flight
plan is completely correct. The code here differs from the code of the previous
post only when there are multiple reconciliations: the first post has code which
fails with an error, whereas this code will use the first reconciliation (which
might be the wrong one). Since <code>reconcile'</code> settles on the first matching
waypoint it is trying to find, to have gone wrong it would have to match some
<code>w</code> in the ICAO list with <code>w1</code> when it should have matched it with <code>w2</code>, for two
waypoints <code>w1</code> and <code>w2</code> in the ADEXP list, appearing in that order. This would
mean that there is a leg of the ICAO flight plan which skips over <code>w1</code> and ends
at <code>w2</code>. Since waypoints with duplicate names are supposed to be very far apart,
and flight plan legs are <em>not</em> supposed to be over very long distances, this
shouldn't happen. Indeed this requirement is in place precisely to avoid flight
plans being ambiguous.</p>
<p>The code of the original blog post was proceeding with an &quot;abundance of caution&quot;
so to speak.</p>
<p>Full code <a href="https://github.com/jameshaydon/uk-portion-of-ICAO" title="GitHub">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>To summarise:</strong><br/> This coding style represents the objects of the domain
with programming values. It operates on these values with semantically
meaningful operations, e.g. &quot;removing the first leg of a flight plan results in
a flight plan&quot;. So in the end you get a valid flight plan, not indices into a
list which doesn't mean anything.</p>
<p><em>In my opinion</em>, it is important that we slowly move towards such a coding
style. I would hope to see this style used more and more in industry, especially
in critical software.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's possible to code in this style in most languages.</li>
<li>It's possible to code in non-correct-by-construction style in <em>all</em> languages.</li>
<li>But <strong><em>in my opinion</em></strong>, some languages lend themselves more to this style
than others, for example, those that are functional.</li>
<li>Correct-by-construction style most certainly doesn't prevent <em>all</em> bugs, just
some of them.</li>
<li>There are many other techniques/tools to prevent bugs.</li>
<li>Static types are <em>not</em> a prerequisite to correct-by-construction style (though
they do help in my opinion). I've seen these ideas espoused by the
<a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> community, for example.</li>
<li>Languages with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type">dependent types</a>
or <a href="https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell/">SMT plugins</a> allow
invariants to be machine-verified.</li>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>&quot;Correct-by-construction&quot; usually refers to something more precise than what I am talking about here. Most people would use this term when the criteria for &quot;correct&quot; are clearly stated, and the correctness is formally verified. I couldn't think of any other term to describe this coding style though.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>Closer conceptually, and in terms of the call graph/code. Failing close to the root cause is why assertions are useful for example, even though this can be counter-intuitive at first (&quot;why instruct the progam to failmore?&quot;). This is also why JavaScript can so hard to debug: it does its damdest to not fail at all at every turn.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="3"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">3</sup>
<p>Of course I know it's impossible for me to know what I would have coded had someone not shouted &quot;DUPLICATE WAYPOINTS&quot; in my ear, but I am trying my best.</p>
