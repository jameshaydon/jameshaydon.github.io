      <p>This is part 3 of my blog posts about the UK air traffic control meltdown. You might want to read <a href="/nats-fail">part one</a> and <a href="/what-went-wrong">part two</a>.</p>
<p>Having had some time to process some of the numerous comments about my first
post, I realise now that I was not clear in communicating my thoughts about the
programming style, and what led to the bug. I will have another go now. The
point I was trying to make was:</p>
<p>With a better programming style, the bug would not have been made <strong>even if the
code is only meant for flight plans with no duplicate waypoints</strong>.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>The comments I am referring to are of the sort:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why the &quot;out of the blue&quot; comment about &quot;imperative&quot; programming in the middle
of the post?</li>
<li>What is even meant by &quot;imperative&quot; programming?</li>
<li>Why blame the bug on programming style, when it is just that the original code
was not aware of the possibility of waypoints with duplicate names? The
original algorithm works fine on those flight plans.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I hope to convince you of in this post is that: The programming style does
matter, the bug would not have been made with a certain sort of programming
style, even if the programmer was not aware of the duplicate waypoint issue.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-i-mean-by-imperative">What did I mean by &quot;imperative&quot;?</h2>
<p>A user on HackerNews <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37472846">replied</a> to
such a query:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Typically it would be used to mean things like the code mutates data in place
rather than using persistent data structures, explicitly loops over data
rather than using higher-order map, fold etc. operations, and explicitly
checks tag bits rather than using sum types.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great answer. But I think I should have used &quot;not
correct-by-construction style&quot; instead. There is no precise
definition of what this means, but it would at least include:</p>
<ul>
<li>representing domain objects with data structures,</li>
<li>only operating on them with functions that are known to preserve invariants,
that is are &quot;safe&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="another-look-at-the-problem">Another look at the problem</h2>
<p>Let us from now on assume that <strong><em>we do not know that a flight plan can contain
duplicate waypoints</em></strong>, and that we <strong><em>assume they are unique</em></strong>, and look at
the problem anew.</p>
<p>We are given two versions of the flight plan, ICAO and ADEXP, each containing
information the other does not have. Our goal is to extract the UK part of the
ICAO flight plan, using in particular data from the ADEXP plan.</p>
<p>One possibility, which sounds like what the original code did, is to keep the
data as it is, and perform various operations in a <code>while</code> loop which mutate
some variables like <code>current_endpoint_candidate</code> until we are satisfied we have
found two indexes <code>start_idx</code> and <code>end_idx</code> which delimit the UK portion of the
flight plan we are looking for. This is not correct by construction: the end
result is an <code>end_idx</code> which for which <code>end_idx &lt; start_idx</code>. The code has &quot;gone
wrong&quot;, and not noticed. Noticing that something has gone wrong is important:
the closer you are to the root cause, the more likely the exception will contain
the information actually is really relevant to those who are dealing with the
crash. It may even have failed gracefully at this point.</p>
<p>The correct-by-construction approach, at least the one that I chose, is to
operate on a version of the flight plan that combines all the information you
need. This therefore involves a first step which works out how the ICAO and
ADEXP plans &quot;match up&quot;.</p>
<p>So we write a function to do this, which we call <code>reconcile'</code>. Since we don't
expect duplicate waypoint names, the plans will only match up in one way (or not
at all): each point of the ICAO plan corresponds uniquely with one point of the
ADEXP plan. So instead of returning a list of reconciliations (as in the
original post), we return a <code>Maybe</code>:</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-haskell "><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">reconcile&#39; </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">::</span><span> (</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">Eq </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">p</span><span>) </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">=&gt; ICAO </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">p r </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">-&gt;</span><span> [</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">p</span><span>] </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">-&gt; Maybe</span><span> (</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">Combined </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">p r</span><span>)

</span><span>reconcile&#39; (</span><span style="color:#d08770;">Leg</span><span> p r rest) (p&#39; : ps) | p == p&#39; = </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">do

</span><span>reconcile&#39; _ _ = </span><span style="color:#d08770;">Nothing
</span></code></pre>
<p>This function is simpler than <code>reconcile</code> from the original post and does the
obvious thing: when reconciling a leg of the ICAO plan with the ADEXP list, it
will skip all the ADEXP points that are not equal to the next point in the ICAO
plan, and then reconciles the rest of the plan recursively.</p>
<p>The code for extracting the UK part of the plan is the same as in the original
post, this is quite simple once we have the flight plan which combines all the
information. All that changes is pattern matching on <code>Maybe</code> instead of a list:</p>

<p>The reason it still works is that the reconciliation still exists, and the
duplicate waypoint doesn't get in the way of finding it. The reconciliation is
also unique in this case, so the processing of the flight plan is completely
correct. The only case in which it differs from the code of the previous post is
when there are multiple reconciliations: the first post has code which fails
with a an error, whereas this code will take the first reconciliation (which
might be the wrong one). This would only happen if there are duplicate waypoints
in in the ADEXP list, say <code>w1</code> and <code>w2</code>, appearing in that order. Since
<code>reconcile'</code> selects the first matching waypoint, to have gone wrong it would
match <code>w</code> in the ICAO list with <code>w1</code> when it should have matched it with <code>w2</code>.
This would mean that there is a leg of the ICAO flight plan which <em>skips</em> <code>w1</code>
and ends at <code>w2</code>. Since waypoints with duplicate names are supposed to be very
far apart, and flight plan legs are <em>not</em> supposed to be over very long
distances, this shouldn't happen. The code of the original blog post was
proceeding with an &quot;abundance of caution&quot; so to speak.</p>
<p>Full code <a href="https://github.com/jameshaydon/uk-portion-of-ICAO" title="GitHub">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>To summarise:</strong><br/> This coding style represents the objects of the domain
with data structures. It operates on those structures with semantically
meaningful operations, e.g. &quot;removing the first leg of a flight plan results in
a flight plan&quot;. So in the end you get a valid flight plan, not indexes into a
list which don't mean anything.</p>
<p><em>In my opinion</em>, it is important that we slowly move to such a coding style. I
would hope to see this style used more and more in industry, especially in
critical software.</p>
<p>Note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's possible to code in this style in most languages.</li>
<li>It's possible to code in non-correct-by-construction style in <em>all</em> languages.</li>
<li>But <strong><em>in my opinion</em></strong>, some languages lend themselves more to this style
than others.</li>
</ul>
